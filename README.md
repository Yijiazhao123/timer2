**Introduction**: Nerve of Steel is a two-player game where players must sit down before the timer runs out. The last player to sit down wins.

A random time between 10 to 25 seconds is selected for the timer.
During this time, players can sit down, and the program will track the order of players who sit.
Once the timer ends, any players still standing are eliminated, and the last player to sit wins.
